# tailwindv2-parcel

This is a basic project putting [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS version 2 together with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). Was not able to get this to play nice with PostCSS 8, so ended up going with the PostCSS 7 compatible version of Tailwind v2. This does not have any impact on Tailwind v2 features though.

The repo is discussed in detail at [Tailwind.Club](https://tailwind.club/setting-up-tailwind-v2-with-parcel/). If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## Usage

To get going, simply fork the repo and run the following commands.

-   **Development:**
    `yarn start` will run a development server with hot reloading at <localhost:1234>
-   **Production:**
    `yarn build` will bundle everything up on your `/dist` folder
